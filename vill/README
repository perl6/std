1. OVERVIEW

Perl 6 is a new dialect of Perl.  The official grammar for Perl 6 is
called STD.pm6, and it is (self referentially) written in Perl 6.  There
is a STD.pm6 based Perl 6 source code parser called 'viv', written in
Perl 5 to help bootstrap new Perl 6 implementations.  Viv converts
source code written in Perl 6 into Viv Abstract Syntax Tree (VAST) form.
See more info at http://perl6.org or chat in #perl6 on irc.freenode.net.

LLVM is an optimizing compiler infrastructure written in C++.  LLVM uses
an Intermediate Representation (IR) format to express the results of
compiling any computer language.  LLVM has tools to interpret IR with or
without a Just In Time (JIT) compiler, and to convert IR to native
machine language for many processors.  LLVM helps you convert any
Abstract Syntax Tree into executable code.  Visit http://llvm.org or
#llvm on irc.oftc.net for the details.

'vill' is the ugly temporary name of this project that connects 'viv' as
Perl 6 front end to LLVM as code generating back end.  It sounds too
much like 'vile', or mock German 'will', but it fits.  Unlike other Perl
implementations such as Pugs, Rakudo, Sprixel and Mildew-js, 'vill'
produces native executable files.  Thus Perl 6 programs depend on 'vill'
and LLVM at compile time but are independent at run time.  Linking to
native code libraries should be fairly easy, but dynamic functions such
as 'eval' are difficult to do (and they add a run time 'vill' and LLVM
dependency).  At the very least 'vill' offers a familiar base from which
to explore LLVM.  Perhaps in time there will be enough functionality to
make it useful in a similar way to NQP (Not Quite Perl 6).

The slowest part of 'vill' is 'viv', because that runs as a separate
Perl 5 child process.  The medium term plan will be to use the STD.pm6
grammar, but replace the 'viv' parser with a new one to be written in C.
This new parser would call a new Perl 6 compatible regex engine (p6re),
probably also written in C. Patrick R. Michaud gave some maybe
useful code for that: http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/changeset/7051/ ;-)
The full Perl 6 regex language is too much to aim for, because action
methods are allowed to contain arbitrary Perl 6 code.  A particular
subset of the regex language is needed by STD.pm6, and the plan would be
to fake what cannot be implemented, using STD specific workarounds.

If the dependency on 'viv' can be removed, the ugly 'vill' name will no
longer be appropriate, and it will be time to think of a better one, and
also to find a new home outside of pugs.  But not before... ;-)

The short term plan is to build in some vaguely useful functionality in
order to perform some real world work.  Whilst that is happening, it
would be nice to execute a bit of the standard Perl 6 test suite using
the 'viv' parser.  Hopefully some semantics (algorithms, MOP) can be
translated from Mildew, Rakudo etc to LLVM Intermediate Representation.
The code geneneration part should remain the same even with different
parsers.  A very long term plan (after a native parser has been added)
is to change down from C++ into C to be more portable, because LLVM
apparently has a C API as well.  Syntax specific to C++ is therefore
staying at a minimum.

The 'vill' project was inspired by 'vijs', the former name of Sprixel,
which uses Google's V8 JavaScript runtime engine and JIT compiler.
Sprixel switched from viv parsing to NQP, but there are no such plans
for vill.  The use of STD.pm is preferred because STD.pm is the official
Perl 6 definition, it is being actively developed, and results in fewer
dependencies on other software.  Some chats in #parrot about possibly
converting Parrot to be LLVM based gave the idea of 'vill' going that
route instead of V8.  The migration of Parrot would be a far bigger
project, because Parrot is a high level virtual machine allowing any
number of different languages to share code and data.

Much credit is due to the creators of the other tools, namely Larry Wall
for STD.pm6 and viv, Chris Lattner for LLVM, and Matthew Wilson for
Sprixel.  The authors of 'vill' are named in the CREDITS file.

2. GETTING STARTED

A Unix-ish environment is currently assumed.  See Appendix A of this
README for ways to get a make utility, Perl 5, a C and a C++ compiler,
viv and LLVM working.

After everything is installed, build and test vill:

    cd pugs/src/perl6/vill
    make
    make help
    make test

The Makefile has an LLVM version check in it, looking for 2.6. If you
get a make error about llvm-version2.6, go back and sort that out first.
Use 'llvm-config --version' to verify that you've got it right.

Now you should be able to run it:

    vill -e 'print "howdy!"'

3. DESIGN

The main program (main.cpp) is deliberately clean and pretty to draw the
reader towards the details beyond.  It creates a villCompiler object and
calls the top level methods in turn.  The load_ast() method reads AST
from viv (in YAML format) and converts it into vill (C structs) AST
format.  Every node in the AST has a void pointer member called data.
In vill, the linkCodegen() method traverses the AST and sets the data
member of each node to point to an LLVM style *Codegen() function.  All
such *Codegen() functions use LLVM methods to generate LLVM Intermediate
Representation (IR) code for particular kinds of AST node.  For example,
every AST arglist node has its data member pointed to the vill arglist()
function and every statement node points to the statement() function.
Straightforward, right?

The codegen() method generates an LLVM Module by calling the *Codegen()
function in the vill AST root node, which always points to comp_unit().
The comp_unit() code examines the root node attributes and children, and
in the order appropriate for a comp_unit, calls LLVM methods to generate
IR code, and calls potentially recursive *Codegen() functions that the
children point to.  When comp_unit() returns to compile() it has
completed the construction of an LLVM Module object.  That's what
compilers do.

In nested fashion each *Codegen() function called from a parent node in
the AST generates IR of its own and calls *Codegen() functions for the
AST nodes of its children.  Eventually the *Codegen() functions of the
AST leaf nodes (for example Str) generate IR but have no children
to recurse further.  Each *Codegen() function returns an LLVM Function *
or Value * pointer to the block of code it has generated, which the
calling *Codegen() function links appropriately to the code that it is
generating for the parent node.

The optimize() method does not work yet but is intended to call numerous
LLVM passes that improve the Module code structure.  For example, LLVM
code transformations do constant propagation, loop invariant code
motion, dead code removal and tail call elimination.

The save() method writes the Module to a file and converts that to
native machine language for the local host.  If you do not specify an
output file name, it uses "/tmp/a.out".  The run() method then executes
the output (currently as a child process).  You can also copy the
executable and run it on other computers that do not have viv, LLVM or
vill installed.

LLVM has data types useful for building more complex language types, for
example the arbitrary width integer type specifies from i1 (one bit) to
i8388607 (a 2^23-1 bit number, or a 2525223 digit decimal number).
Since a Googol is merely 100 decimal digits, an LLVM based Big Rational
would seldom approach its limits.

The eval(EXPR) function is particularly challenging, as the expression
to be executed is not known until run time.  The old eval(BLOCK) is now
done by the try {... CATCH {...}} construct, and was the most frequently
documented Perl 5 usage.  Certain other code needs eval(EXPR), but seems
to be rare enough (subjective opinion) that the majority of programs
should be spared the high overhead involved (a runtime containing a
compiler).  In a different but instructive case, many Perl 5 users
prefer no ithreads capability that causes a reported 15% slowdown for
all programs (Perl 5 can be built without ithreads).

The 'vill' plan for eval(EXPR) is therefore as follows.  The main
running program starts a 'vill' subprocess and ask it to produce a
temporary library file.  The main program dynamically loads the library
and call the code to be eval'ed, receiving a Parcel with the returned
results.  The library file is cached and later deleted.  More precise
details have not even begun to speculate about the possibility of
crossing the designer's mind.

4. SOURCE CODE CONVENTIONS

As 'vill' is a C and C++ LLVM based project, it follows the LLVM
programming guidelines, see http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html.
In files which change a lot, prefer clarity before performance.  Do not
be too rigid - minor deviations from the guidelines might make a file
more readable.  Remember perlstyle and the Intent of perlpod.

The source code is divided into many small source files for several
reasons.  Open Source projects should be simple in structure to welcome
new participants.  It must be easy to finding the right file.  There is
less complexity per source file (but of course there are more files).
People committing changes at the same time have fewer conflict and merge
problems.  The make utility selectively recompiles small parts more
quickly.

The directory hierarchy is flat (all in src/ and test/).  Do not add
directories lightly; doc/ is waiting until this README becomes unwieldy.

The file name convention is: "indentifier name" ~~ "source file name".
Thus every externally linkable function or method is defined in its own
source file based on the same name.  The pugs/v6/mildew tree has a very
similar approach.  Prefix 'local_' to names of identifiers not intended
to be externally linkable, that helps find definitions quickly.
There are only two minor exceptions so far:
1) The C test source files contain a main() function as entry point in
addition to the test function whose name matches the source file name.
2) The destructor ~villCompiler() is in the same file as the constructor
because the ~ character would be confusing on a file name.

Limit the length of source code lines to 72 characters (this README is
an example).  Tolerate longer lines in the short term for expediency.
Indent code with two spaces (never tabs) per level.  Vertically align as
much similar code in successive lines as possible.  Use optional curly
braces in flow control blocks, to more closely resemble Perl style.
Declare return types in separate lines before function or method names.  

Use long descriptive identifier names.  Declare identifiers separately
before their first assignment, unless the value is a trivial constant.
Keep lists of names sorted alphabetically as far as dependencies allow.
That applies to #include file names, cases in switch blocks,
enumerations etc.  Annotate #include directives with a (sorted) list of
names that the enclosing file depends on from that header file.
Periodically comment out #include directives one by one to see (from
compiler errors) that the header file is still needed, and what for.  If
it is not used, cut it out!

Use simple explanatory constructs, for example, if ( p1 != NULL ) rather
than if ( p1 ).  The compiler probably produces the same code anyway.
Use assert() very liberally.  Put a space between the * and the name of
a pointer to make it stand out.

Comment verbosely, especially with the reasons for the code.  Use only C
style comments in C language files, and C++ style comments in C++ source
files.  When writing C style comments, begin and end them on the same
line.  (Therefore never write multiline comments.)  To temporarily
exclude lines of source code, use #if 0 and #endif instead.

The location of <malloc.h> is inconsistent across different operating
systems such as Linux and OS X, so <stdlib.h> should be used as a more
portable substitute.  Thanks to masak++ and diakopter++ for diagnosing.

5. VIRTUAL MACHINE

Of course LLVM is a virtual machine, but it's such a low level one that
it virtually (pun intended) disappears.  Code is compiled and optimized
in Intermediate Representation (IR) format, also referred to as bitcode.
The IR similar in principle to Parrot's PIR.  LLVM offers a bitcode
interpreter, a runtime engine with JIT compiler (similar to Google's V8)
and a linker that produces native executables.

Perl users often ask how to compile to native executables, so 'vill' has
opted for that LLVM feature from the start.  The code generation process
generates only as much virtual machine support code as the program being
compiled needs.  Simple one liners become standalone executables smaller
than 10KB with quick startup and execution times.  There is currently
too little functionality in 'vill' to get experience with more complex
programs.

6. NATIVE EXECUTABLE CACHE

There are plans to cache the compiled output files in /tmp/vill.  The
idea comes from Walter Bright, of Zortech C++ and D compiler fame.  When
a new 'vill' program is started, a 'make' style file and timestamp check
will allow the time consuming compile process to be skipped if possible.
Command lines executed with the -e option will enjoy similar cacheing,
tracked by a suitable checksum or digest.  The -c option will probably
also purge the cache and force a recompile.  Eventually a similar
approach might compile modules into shared libraries, but that concept
would first need more planning.

7. PARSER REPLACEMENT

Creating an in-process parser for standard Perl 6 language (STD.pm) is a
medium term plan for 'vill'.  Achieving it would mark the end of 'vill'
as project name, because the 'viv' dependency would go, and the speed of
compiling should improve.  It's very High Hanging Fruit and far away on
the roadmap.

The basis of a Perl 6 parser is a Perl 6 regex engine, so that needs to
be written first, preferably in C.  The regex engine in nqp-rx has been
suggested (by its author;) as a good starting point for porting, but
nothing has been done yet to confirm the viability of such a port.  Even
a limited regex engine would be useful to end user programs.

Parsing Perl 6 is a more advanced stage, because the regex engine must
be able to handle all of STD.pm, which is a large Perl 6 grammar that is
still evolving.  Fortunately the engine still does not have to implement
the entire Perl 6 regex language, only the subset that STD.pm uses.  It
will require Longest Token Matching, which for example Rakudo currently
lacks.

The new parser must match the user's Perl 6 program (let's ignore Perl 5
for now) to the STD.pm grammar, which also contains action methods
written in a small subset of Perl 6.  The subset is small because gimme5
must be able to translate it to Perl 5 when making viv.  The parser
executes the action methods when parsing the user's Perl 6 code and
creating the Abstract Syntax Tree.

The plan is to program equivalents for the simplest and most frequently
occurring Perl 6 statements in the action methods as parameterized
general purpose C functions, and to recognize the rest of the Perl 6
statements and implement them with individual custom substitutes, also
in C.  The viability of this approach is uncertain.  There will probably
be a parser generation stage that creates some of the C code dynamically
from STD.pm, before compiling and linking that into the main compiler.

8. CONTINUATION PASSING STYLE (CPS)

At the end of http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl8.html in "Garbage
Collected Stack Frames", the documentation confirms that LLVM supports
ways to manage stack frames and also tail calls.  CPS is useful when
implementing lazy evaluation and multithreading, but is not necessary
for regular procedural code.

The 'vill' project is still a conventional stack based implementation
(therefore not CPS) for the following reasons.  For a novice LLVM user,
there are no CPS based examples, only Static Single Assignment (SSA)
ones instead (using 'Function *' and 'Value *' in the code).
Observation of Rakudo (which is Parrot CPS based) raises concerns about
speed and memory leaks.  CPS uses heap memory instead of stack, and heap
management (garbage collection etc) is a big overhead.  The speed of
Parrot and Rakudo are far short of Perl 5, which is not CPS based.  On
the other hand Perl 5 is not good at concurrency.

CPS is a calling convention.  The plan is to default to stack based, and
add optional CPS in *Codegen() functions under the control of a 'vill'
command line argument.  That way the processor and memory overheads of
CPS and stack based can be compared when running a variety of Perl 6
programs.  Eventually there might be an automatic switch depending on
information in the AST.  It may also be possible to associate a calling
convention with each called routine, so that the appropriate one is
employed per call.  Presumably Pugs also did such things.

9. CONTRIBUTING

Anyone with Pugs commit access is welcome to hack on 'vill', generally
as long as the changes improve it.  Join #perl6 on irc.freenode.net to
meet other contributors.  Not Yet Implemented (NYI) bits of Perl 6 code
successfully make it through viv into the AST, only to fail because of
missing or incomplete *Codegen() functions.

New hackers can grep for TODO comments, particularly those also marked
(LHF) (low hanging fruit), or run 'make todo' or 'make fruit' instead.
Experienced hackers are requested not to greedily consume all the fruit
they can, on the contrary please put even more fruit onto the (source)
tree to tempt others to get involved.  Perhaps one piece of LHF per
person per week/month is a fair ration.

Here are some guidelines for a typical contribution.  Recall the Source
Code Conventions above.  Let's add a fictitious missing 'zap' operator
(please don't actually implement zap;) :

1. A '!perl/hash:VAST::infix__S_zap is not yet implemented in vill'
   message appears when you run a Perl 6 program that uses zap.
2. Make the simplest example the triggers the same message.  View its
   parse tree by using a command like: ./vill -Dp -e' "foo" zap "bar" '
3. Add infix__S_zap to 'Codegen functions' in src/villCompiler.h.
4. Add infix__S_zap to local_Codegen() in src/link_codegen.cpp.
5. Add src/infix__S_zap.o to the 'objects' list in vill/Makefile.
   Add it at the right place in the 'Object targets' list there as well.
6. Copy the source file most similar in functionality (in your opinion)
   to src/infix__S_zap.cpp, and edit the comment, function name and
   debug trace text.  Or, create a new file from scratch.  Next the
   hard/easy part: make it Do The Right Thing.  Study the parse tree
   from step 2 for ideas.
7. Run 'make', 'make test', and test your code.  Use various vill -D
   options (eg -DU, see vill -H) for diagnostics.  Edit, save, repeat.
8. Discuss in #perl6.  Commit into svn.pugscode.org if successful.  If
   your work reveals similar code that others could write, add a comment
   by your entry in link_codegen.cpp like: // TODO: (LHF) zop zup etc

The procedure for adding a new built in function is similar.

10. ROADMAP (PARTIAL)

1. Fix src/yaml_compose.c so that all reasonable Perl 6 inputs to
   test/yaml_compose_roundtrip.c are handled properly.
2. Do 'print'.  Get ./vill -e 'print "hello"' to work.
   Leave 'say' TODO as the first LHF, to tempt some collaborators.
3. Do 'if'.  Get if "1" eq "1" { say "true" } to work.
   Use the LLVM Tutorial examples Kaleidoscope and BrainF for ideas.
   Leave 'else' and 'while' as the next LHF, they use similar coding.
4. Do scalar variables and assignment (this is hard, see LLVM examples).
   Initially just Str, so that "11" + "12" evaluates to "23" not 23.
5. Seed a few operators such as ~ and ==, leave others like gt and x as
   LHF.
6. Try adding Int alongside Str and if that works, Num.  Leave room for
   all other built in data types.
7. Design LLVM based machinery for lists, arrays and hashes.  Connect
   some AST *Codegen() functions to exercise it, eg @arr[$i] lvalue and
   rvalue.
8. Do 'sub'.  Use calling conventions from the LLVM examples.  Initially
   pass parameters via @_, ignore the more advanced options.  Hard.
9. Make 'use Test'.  Lots of faking acceptable, the goal is to run some
   code, any code out of the spectest suite.
10. Plan how to begin implementing rakudo/docs/metamodel.pod in LLVM IR.
11. Add a 'make snapshot' to create an installable archive, including
    the required subset of the spectest suite at that time.
12. ...

11. STATUS

The LLVM code generator has been hard wired to produce an executable
that prints "vill compiled A\nvill compiled Z\n" when run.  During early
testing the output file (test/hello) measured 8437 bytes on x86 or 9014
bytes on amd64 (Linux).  It runs completely standalone.

Currently everything is EXPERIMENTAL.
There may be some breakage due to fiddling in src/yaml_compose.c .
In src/ these work: compile.cpp make_puts.cpp run.cpp and save.cpp.
In test/ these work: yaml_token_roundtrip and test/yaml_parse_roundtrip.

Item 1. is stalled, test/yaml_compose_roundtrip runs but fails to
traverse the entire tree, because src/graph_traverse is incomplete.  The
integrity of the composed AST looks good though, for example try:

    ./vill -Ds -e 'my $foo="bar"; print $foo;'

Despite item 1. stalling, test runs of ./vill -DU -e'print 12 + 34'
and similar show the entire AST being traversed.  The -DU option allows
ad hoc checking of link_codegen() and codegen() operation, which is not
complete but correct so far.  Therefore work is continuing on item 2. as
well.

APPENDIX A: Required software

How to get the software required to run 'vill':

make:

Supplied as a software development tool for most operating systems.
The GNU make utility can be found at http://gnu.org .
On a Debian or Ubuntu system, install make with:

    sudo apt-get install make

Perl 5:

Your computer may have a usable version of Perl 5 installed anyway.  You
need perl version 5.10.0 or higher.  You can try this command to check:

    /usr/local/bin/perl -v

Note that 'viv', used by 'vill' needs the path exactly as written above.
Your system might have Perl 5 installed in another directory.  You can
find out with these commands:

    which perl
    ls -l /usr/local/bin/perl

If your perl is not in /usr/local/bin but elsewhere, for example in
/usr/bin, a command such as the following may help by creating a
symbolic link:

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin

Visit http://perl.com if you need information about installing Perl 5.

c++:

Most operating systems have a package to install a c++ compiler. You may
need to use one of these commands:

    sudo apt-get install g++     # on a Debian style system (eg Ubuntu)
    yum install g++              # on Fedora or Red Hat

Subversion:

    sudo apt-get install subversion

viv:

Use Subversion to check out either the complete Pugs repository, or just
the parts that contains viv and vill:

    svn checkout http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs pugs  # the entire repo
    sudo cpan -i YAML::XS # or 'sudo apt-get libyaml-libyaml-perl'
    sudo cpan -i Moose
    cd pugs/src/perl6
    time make

ffi:

The Foreign Function Interface library:

    sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

LLVM:

Currently this project works only with version 2.6, the development
version (2.7beta) changes too rapidly.

    sudo apt-get install llvm     # Ubuntu 9.10

Note: LLVM 2.7 will be released in march 2010, so this dependency is
about to change in a non-backwards-compatible way.  It's for the best :)

Version 2.5 included with many other operating systems is too old.  On
such platforms build LLVM from source:

    wget http://llvm.org/releases/2.6/llvm-2.6.tar.gz
    tar xzf llvm-2.6.tar.gz
    cd llvm-2.6
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-optimized \
      --enable-targets=host-only
    time make                     # 25 - 45 minutes
    sudo make install
